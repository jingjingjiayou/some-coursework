# some-coursework
The repository includes some simple Matlab codes: Patchwork, snake, DWT-DCT-SVD

1. DWT-DCT-SVD:

Based on DCT-DWT-SVD digital watermark embedding and extraction algorithm.
The program implements embedding the image into the audio. The code contains robustness detection, such as gaussian noise, resample, and low pass filtering...
* Qdwtdctsvd.m: watermark embedding
* Tdwtdctsvd.m: watermark extraction and robustness detection.

2. Patchwork:

Digital watermarking technology based on patchwork algorithm

3. snake-the geodesic active eontour model：

This Matlab program implements the geodesic active contour model.
main.m：the main code.
